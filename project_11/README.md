# Introduction
A used car sales service provider Rusty Bargain intends to develop an app to attract new customers. The app allows users to quickly find out the market values of their cars. 

# Purpose
This project aims to build a regression model to predict the car prices. The model performance should based on the following criteria as requested by Rusty Bargain:

- The quality of the prediction
- The speed of the prediction
- The time required for training
