# Introduction
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether data science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.

# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to develop a model using computer vision methods to verify the age of individuals during the checkout process. The model performance will be assessed based on the mean absolute error (MAE) score. **The model should have a MAE score less than 8.**

# Data
The dataset have 7591 people face images of various ages.

# Main Libraries Used
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Keras
